Alarm Handling
React Native: react-native-push-notification



1. Initial Setup
‚úÖ React Native Setup
Install Node.js, Watchman, JDK (if Android), and Android Studio/Xcode

Create project:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx react-native init LocationAlarmApp
‚úÖ Firebase Setup
Create Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com

Add both Android & iOS apps in the Firebase console

Download google-services.json (Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS)

Install React Native Firebase:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @react-native-firebase/app
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
üåê 2. Google Maps Integration
Install maps:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install react-native-maps
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
Enable Google Maps SDK and Places API in Google Cloud Console

Add API keys to both Android and iOS

‚úÖ Features to Build:
Search bar using Google Places API

Map marker at selected address

Radius circle around selected location

üìç 3. Geolocation & Geofencing
Libraries:
react-native-background-geolocation (for reliable tracking)

react-native-geolocation-service (simpler but less robust)

Steps:
Ask for location permission

Track user's live location

Use geofencing logic to check when user enters defined radius

Use Haversine formula or geofencing packages to detect entry

‚è∞ 4. Alarm Trigger & Notification
Use:
react-native-push-notification or

@react-native-firebase/messaging (for FCM + local fallback)

Logic:
When user enters radius ‚Üí trigger local notification/alarm sound

Handle in background or headless task on Android

‚òÅÔ∏è 5. Firebase Integration
Features:
Authentication (optional for personal usage)

Email/Password or Anonymous login

Firestore to store:

User ID

Target location (lat/lng)

Radius

Alarm status

Setup:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/firestore
üß™ 6. Testing
Test background location on real devices

Handle iOS/Android permission differences

Add fallback logic (e.g., if location not available)

Test alarm trigger on entering radius

üé® 7. Polish the UI
Use libraries like:

react-native-paper or react-native-elements for styled components

Add UX for:

Map interaction

Radius slider

Alarm toggling

Background location explanations

üì¶ 8. Build & Deploy
Android:
Generate signed APK or AAB

Deploy via Google Play Console

iOS:
Setup with Apple Developer Program

Build with Xcode & deploy via TestFlight/App Store
